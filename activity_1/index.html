    <h1>Food & Nutrition</h1>
    <h2>Food Pyramid vs Plate Ratio</h2>
    <p>These are the food groups for the food pyramid, 1 being the what we should consume the most, 5 being what we
        should consume the least.
    <ol>
        <li>Grains: 6-11 servings</li>
        <li>Fruit: 2-4 servings</li>
        <li>Vegetables: 3-5 servings</li>
        <li>Meat, Poultry, Fish, Dry Beans, Eggs & Nuts: 2-3 servings</li>
        <li>Milk, Yogurt, & Cheese: 2-3 servings</li>
        <li>Fats, Oils, Sweets: use sparingly</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>These are the food groups for plate ratio.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fruits: </li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Grains</li>
        <li>Protein</li>
        <li>Dairy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The food groups now have transitioned from <b>pyramid style</b> to <b>plate ratio style</b>. While the idea has
        stayed the
        same, the plate ratio style has broken things down into larger categories, <br> <i>instead</i> of multiple
        blocks to
        build a pyramid. <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-pyramid/">Harvard's School
            of Public Health</a> says: <br>
    <blockquote>"Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy oils, and healthy proteins like nuts, beans, <br>
        fish, and chicken should make it into the shopping cart every week, along with a little yogurt <br>
        or other dairy foods if desired."</blockquote>
